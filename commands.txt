# Important commands for the piper project setup
# ================================
A lot of this work comes from this chat: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-677c45a14c2c8191a7a3ebb1a674ac5d-technology-general/c/67d5f526-6cc8-8006-a31e-78c36401c9d7

# 1. Set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable for this session.
# This tells macOS where to find libespeak-ng.dylib.
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/owen/Developer/Python/youtubeTTS/tts-comparison/modules/piper/pp/install/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

# 2. Run the piper command to synthesize speech and play the output.
# This command converts the text into speech, writes it to output.wav, and then plays it.
echo 'Welcome to the world of speech synthesis!' | piper --model modules/piper/models/en_US-libritts_r-medium.onnx > output.wav && afplay output.wav

# 3.piper --help

# After editing .zshrc, add the following line to have DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH set for every session:
# export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/owen/Developer/Python/youtubeTTS/tts-comparison/modules/piper/pp/install/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

# 4. Copy the espeak-ng-data folder into the Python package directory.
# Run this from the "pp" directory (adjust relative paths if needed).
cp -rp ./install/share/espeak-ng-data ../../../venv/lib/python3.13.2/site-packages/piper_phonemize/espeak-ng-data

# 5. Modify the Shared Libraryâ€™s rpath with install_name_tool
You can add the directory where libespeak-ng.dylib resides to the rpath of the Piper shared object (piper_phonemize_cpp). Run the following command from your terminal:

install_name_tool -add_rpath /Users/owen/Developer/Python/youtubeTTS/tts-comparison/modules/piper/pp/install/lib /Users/owen/Developer/Python/youtubeTTS/tts-comparison/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/piper_phonemize_cpp.cpython-313-darwin.so

This command tells the dynamic linker to also search in your specified directory when loading libraries for that shared object. After running it, try executing your script again.
